# Tacotron 2 Training Arpabet Kaggle
This is a notebook from Kaggle I had made that allows user's to make their own AI voices using 16bit PCM, 22050 HZ WAV files on the Neural networks provided by NVIDIA's creation of Tacotron 2 that has been slightly modified to use arpabet to help the model enunciate words better when synthesizing.
